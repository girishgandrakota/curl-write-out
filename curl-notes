Curl Output

* %{content_type} shows the Content-Type of the requested document, if there was any.
* %{filename_effective} shows the ultimate filename that curl writes out to. This is only meaningful if curl is told to write to a file with the --remote-name or --output option. It's most useful in combination with the --remote-header-name option.
* %{ftp_entry_path} shows the initial path curl ended up in when logging on to the remote FTP server.
* %{http_code} the old variable name for what is now known as response_code.
* %{http_connect} shows the numerical code that was found in the last response (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request.
* %{http_version} The http version that was used.
* %{json} shows all write-out variables as a single JSON object.
* %{local_ip} shows the IP address of the local end of the most recently done connection—can be either IPv4 or IPv6
* %{local_port} shows the local port number of the most recently made connection
* %{num_connects} shows the number of new connects made in the recent transfer.
* %{num_redirects} shows the number of redirects that were followed in the request.
* %{proxy_ssl_verify_result} shows the result of the SSL peer certificate verification that was requested when communicating with a proxy. 0 means the verification was successful.
* %{redirect_url} shows the actual URL a redirect would take you to when an HTTP request was made without -L to follow redirects.
* %{remote_ip} shows the remote IP address of the most recently made connection—can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
* %{remote_port} shows the remote port number of the most recently made connection.
* %{response_code} shows the numerical response code that was found in the last transfer.
* %{scheme} shows scheme used in the previous URL
* %{size_download} shows the total number of bytes that were downloaded.
* %{size_header} shows the total number of bytes of the downloaded headers.
* %{size_request} shows the total number of bytes that were sent in the HTTP request.
* %{size_upload} shows the total number of bytes that were uploaded.
* %{speed_download} shows the average download speed that curl measured for the complete download in bytes per second.
* %{speed_upload} shows the average upload speed that curl measured for the complete upload in bytes per second.
* %{ssl_verify_result} shows the result of the SSL peer certificate verification that was requested. 0 means the verification was successful.
* %{stderr} - makes the rest of the output get written to stderr.
* %{stdout} - makes the rest of the output get written to stdout.
* %{time_appconnect} shows the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the remote host was completed.
* %{time_connect} shows the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
* %{time_namelookup} shows the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the name resolving was completed.
* %{time_pretransfer} shows the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the file transfer was just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
* %{time_redirect} shows the time, in seconds, it took for all redirection steps including name lookup, connect, pre-transfer and transfer before the final transaction was started. time_redirect shows the complete execution time for multiple redirections.
* %{time_starttransfer} shows the time, in seconds, it took from the start until the first byte was just about to be transferred. This includes time_pretransfer and also the time the server needed to calculate the result.
* %{time_total} shows the total time, in seconds, that the full operation lasted. The time will be displayed with millisecond resolution.
* %{url_effective} shows the URL that was fetched last. This is particularly meaningful if you have told curl to follow Location: headers (with -L).
